# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a Japanese-language terminal tutorial repository containing educational materials for beginners learning command-line interfaces. The repository consists of tutorial markdown files covering different terminal environments and version control:

1. **dos-prompt-basics.md** - Windows Command Prompt (DOS prompt) basics
2. **powershell-basics.md** - Windows PowerShell basics  
3. **mac-bash-zsh-basics.md** - macOS bash/zsh basics
4. **git-basics.md** - Git version control for all environments

Each tutorial chapter includes:
- Basic command explanations
- File and directory operations
- Environment variables and paths
- Practice exercises with solutions

## Content Structure

All content is in Japanese and follows a consistent format:
- Introduction to the shell/terminal
- Basic commands with examples
- System-specific features
- Practice problems (練習問題) followed by solutions (解答)

## Key Considerations

When modifying or adding to this repository:
- Maintain consistency with the existing Japanese language and formatting
- Each platform-specific tutorial should remain self-contained
- Practice problems should be progressive and build on previous concepts
- Command examples should be safe for beginners (no admin/sudo commands)
- Solutions should be provided immediately after the practice problems section

## Tutorial Format Guidelines

Each tutorial file should follow this structure:
1. Introduction section explaining what the tool/shell is
2. Installation instructions (if applicable)
3. Basic commands with clear examples
4. Advanced features or environment-specific tips
5. Practice problems (練習問題) section
6. Solutions (解答) section immediately following the problems
7. Summary (まとめ) section

When adding new content:
- Use code blocks with appropriate language tags (cmd, powershell, bash)
- Include expected output for commands where helpful
- Provide multiple methods when available (e.g., keyboard shortcuts and menu options)
