# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a Japanese-language terminal tutorial repository containing educational materials for beginners learning command-line interfaces. The repository consists of tutorial markdown files covering three different terminal environments:

1. **dos-prompt-basics.md** - Windows Command Prompt (DOS prompt) basics
2. **powershell-basics.md** - Windows PowerShell basics  
3. **mac-bash-zsh-basics.md** - macOS bash/zsh basics

Each tutorial chapter includes:
- Basic command explanations
- File and directory operations
- Environment variables and paths
- Practice exercises with solutions

## Content Structure

All content is in Japanese and follows a consistent format:
- Introduction to the shell/terminal
- Basic commands with examples
- System-specific features
- Practice problems (練習問題) followed by solutions (解答)

## Key Considerations

When modifying or adding to this repository:
- Maintain consistency with the existing Japanese language and formatting
- Each platform-specific tutorial should remain self-contained
- Practice problems should be progressive and build on previous concepts
- Command examples should be safe for beginners (no admin/sudo commands)
- Solutions should be provided immediately after the practice problems section
